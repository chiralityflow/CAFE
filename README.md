# MadCAFE
Developmental repo for the chiral automised flow extension (MadCAFE) for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO

MadCAFE is a tool based on the MG5aMC framework developed for scattering element 
evaluation using the chirality-flow formalism for the standard model of 
particle physics.

As of this version (revision 2022-03-23) massless tree-level QED has been 
fully implemented. See arXiv:2203.13618 [hep-ph] for further details.

For further details on MG5aMC, see arXiv:1804.10017 [hep-ph], or the MG5aMC development page on Launchpad.
